I have created RestAPI for Book using Spring Boot and Spring MVC. you can see that implementation inside BookController.

I also created one form. Using thymeleaf, in which I used all input tags to test my skills, I used all permutation combinations to take input from thymeleaf and store it in the database.Â 

I used Jparepository, which internally uses the Hibernate framework, to manipulate the data in the database.

During the implementation of this permutatuion combination, I was faced small issues like how to take values from the checkbox, radio button, and selection input.
